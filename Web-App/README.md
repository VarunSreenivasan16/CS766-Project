# Detectron2 Web App

## Description

An interactive computer vision web app that wraps Detectron2's Mask R-CNN for instance segmentation on images. 

The app's backend is built using python and provides a web server hosted with python's flask framework.

The frontend is built using a standard DHTML tech stack including HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Local Setup & Deployment

After installing a few dependencies, the app can be built and run on your local machine in minutes using docker. 

### Prerequisites

- Python3: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Docker: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Build 

* Note: If you get error while building the image, the likely cause is a memory shortage within the container. You can fix this by adjusting the docker Preferences > Resources > Memory. At the time of submission, I have my preferences set to 15 GB and the container is building properly.
